I’m excited to have the opportunity to intern as a Web Developer and Designer at OASIS INFOBYTE. As part of the internship program, I have been assigned three tasks to complete. Upon successful completion and review of these tasks, I will be awarded a certificate. I’m glad to be a part of this enriching learning experience with OASIS INFOBYTE.

# Task Details
**Task 1: Calculator App**

In this task, I developed a calculator web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator allows users to perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The interface is user-friendly and responsive.

**Task 2: Tribute Page - A . P . J Abdul Kalam**

For the second task, I created a tribute page dedicated to A . P . J Abdul Kalam. The page provides information about Dr. Ambedkar's life, achievements, and contributions. It includes a visually appealing design and relevant content to honor his significant impact.

**Task 3: To-do Web App**

The third task involved building a todo web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The todo app allows users to add tasks, mark them as complete, and delete them when necessary. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for managing and organizing tasks effectively.
